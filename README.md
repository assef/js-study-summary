# js-study-resumes

In this repo, I'll resume my (from scratch) JS study sections.

Those files are not a guide, but a resume of the study.

I'm basing my study on the book ["You Don't Know JS" by Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed).

Those texts are no AI generated.
